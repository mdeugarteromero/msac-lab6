# Exercise 5 - Making your first commit

1. If you just completed Exercise 4, `git status` should show that you have "changes to be committed"

2. Commit the changes with the command

        git commit

3. Your editor will open automatically.  Read the text that is already there.

4. Enter your commit message, e.g.

        First commit

5. Save and exit from the editor

6. Check git status again, and paste the contents below.

        git status

On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   exercise01.md
        modified:   exercise02.md
        modified:   exercise03.md
        modified:   exercise04.md
